# ML-Brainstem
This repository is for the Depaul-Rosalind Franklin collaboration regarding the application of ML methodologies to look into the reticular formation.

## Introduction and Background
The brainstem is a complex and integral region of the brain itself, housing an intricate network of neurons that help regulate fundamental physiological functions, specifically vital orofacial motor behaviors. This includes, but is not limited to, the subconscious action of breathing, swallowing, vocalization/speech, and chewing. A disruption within said network, especially during fetal development, can lead to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders such as central apneas, sudden infant death syndrome, dysphagia, and speech impediments. A major roadblock to learning more about these vital neural networks for possible future therapy is the fact that there is a lack of clear cytoarchitectonic boundaries and molecular markers that would otherwise demarcate possible regions for further study and/or medical intervention.  The current understanding of how the brainstem, specifically the reticular formation, is undefined and lacking. 

## Significance
The primary objective of this research effort is to conduct an in-depth investigation into the reticular formation based on gene expression data. This research effort aims to leverage machine learning methodologies to uncover latent relationships between genes, identify key players in the gene regulatory network, and ultimately contribute to a more nuanced comprehension of the brainstem’s role in vital physiological processes.
